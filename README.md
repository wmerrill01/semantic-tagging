# Homework 1 - semantic tagging

<br>

## Objective

Revised existing HTML codes to use semantic tags where appropriate.  I took out almost all of the < div > tags and replaced them with the proper tags. I added the "alt" tag to images. I updated the css file to reflect the changes in the semantic tags that would affect the file. Last I consolidated some of the repeated css elements.
